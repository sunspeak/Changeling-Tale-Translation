    old "\nPúca spirits oft have traits of a domestic animal, such as ears or tail, but be not fooled. These tricksters lurk 'round ev'ry corner, hidden in plain sight. Beware the smiling face in the crowd. Stand clear of the stranger who offers too much bread. For what may they want of you in return?\nThese curious beings run the gamut from helpful to hurtful. They can bear good luck, or portend great misfortune. In shire Caithness 'twas the púca who helped a farmer mill his crop after the bleakest winter harvest, saving the poor man's family from starvation."

    old "On Isle Orkney, a rabbit púca befriended artisan Alastair Webster, but the creature was ne'er seen by another soul. He was sent to the madhouse where he claimed his púca fed him wild berries daily. His story was only taken as truth after his death, when a full pail of bilberry seeds were found in the corner of his cell.\nMost frightening of all was the devilish púca who lured unsuspecting men off the road to Loch Lochy to devour them whole, leaving nothing but piles of hair, bone, and trousers."

    old "\nWhilst the flocks of sheep and passels of hogs are left to their own devices, the steadied and leisurely cows strewn about their pastures are watched over, sheltered and safeguarded by the loving mother milkmaid, the Banarach. The fiery redhead is pure magic, born of the Fae and sent by the faeries to offer her gift to farmers throughout Scotland. Her grace shields the herds from harm and defends them from hidden dangers. The fair maiden Banarach honorably preserves the integrity of the dairy farm."

    old "Her cheeks are ruddy and her heart is pure. She is gifted with beauty matched only by her kindness.  Part cow herself, she blends in with any livestock, so as to perform her duties with as little rustling as possible. The Banarach's delicate, yet cloven, hands glide gently over the Highland heifers' shaggy manes, bestowing them health, longevity, and full udders. Under her apron hides her own udder, full of bounty itself, ready to provide milk to those in need. With each swish of her tail, a sprinkle of imperceptible faerie dust coats the grass that feeds the heifers. Ye'll ne'er be without fresh double cream with the Banarach performing her duties as the herd's main protector.\nWe are to thank the one who protects the herd. Should ye possess four legs and be uttering a low moo... ye'll never walk alone."

    old "\nTiny and nimble, flying faster than most eyes can see, the pixie delights and deceives. Near in size to the pipistrelle bat, a pixie is but a mere miniature human-shaped being with dulcimer wings that emit shining light as they flutter feverishly. These diminutive female figures flit about, most often in the night skies, and ne'er don a whit of garb. Though they perform their aerial dancing unclothed, they have a fondness for stealing scraps of fabric, so best to protect the loose ribbon in yer plait."

    old "Rumors exist of pixies thieving children in the night, luring wee bairns away with a spellbinding glow. Even a young one barely strong enough to walk will follow a pixie near to the fae realm unless the mother keeps a close eye on her. Pixies may even lead a grown man or a trotting horse astray, should either catch the gaze of these impish and alluring sprites.\nPixies are feisty, fearless, and adore exploring new surroundings, able to dip in and out of hidden caves and rushing waters with delicate ease. If you spot a pixie in the darkness, aglow like a candle's flame, know that their presence will always bring blessings to the home of those who show them fondness."

    old "\nThe imposing horned god. The ruling leader of savage beasts and untamed lands. The only voice heard and obeyed by man and fae alike. The mythological conciliator of two worlds. Through his voice, battles were settled, the storms calmed, and wild creatures lived in harmony with civilized men."

    old "Underneath his majestic antlers, cloven hoofs, and unruly beard, the Cernunnos possesses a voice that calms even the most wicked of animals. He is the protector and guiding light. Oft depicted as a holy spirit or deity, the Cernunnos has the strength of many men, but, unprovoked, may be gentle as a newborn lamb. This combination of patience and power gives him the natural ruling authority over his beastly kingdoms, of far away fae realms.\nThose stories told by one's grandfather, or great-great grandfather, holding noteworthy discourse with the Cernunnos, be wary of their tales. No written record exists of a meeting between the Cernunnos and mortal man, because the deity insists that no encounters be documented. His contracts are oral and binding. Any change of heart will result in a man's curse the likes of which could never be survived.\nCan the horned god still be found traipsing in the lush hills or in another world altogether? Most say yes. But seek not the Cernunnos. Should he want an engagement, he will find you himself."

    old "\nOft heard is the legend of the glaistig, the Green Lady, the embittered and beautiful blonde maiden, with a sulky visage and empowered aura. The spiteful spirit bears the name maighdean uaine because she dons a long, green robe to hide her mystical secret. What is that secret, you ask? Her hybrid form, of course. To the naked eye, it would seem this cursed creature is female. But when she reveals her legs, they are those of a satyr—ghastly and gnarled, with hair and cloven toes."

    old "Who is this half-goat woman, with her sallow complexion and spellbinding eyes? Who is hiding behind that mane of flaxen hair? At once indifferent and invasive, the glaistig lives among us, charming you with a kind smile before luring you away to commit unspeakable acts. While known for her protective nature, it is one that comes at a cost, that of expected discreet and everlasting loyalty.\nOnce a mortal, she wronged the fae by testing their boundaries and going too far. Her punishment was that of immortality. Whilst the glaistig lives covertly, she is always around. If you listen closely to footsteps nearby, you may hear the hooves of sadness clicking as they pass."

    old "Despite their agile frames and ability to speak, the Wulver is never born of humans but evolved of the prehistoric wolf. The Wulver has a helpful spirit. They will guide those who are lost, taking them to safer pastures. Wulvers will benevolently feed the poor, leaving freshly caught meat and fish by their windows in the middle of the night from whence they hunt. The Wulver will silently watch over those who are ailing or mourning.\nWhilst legend states that the Wulver holds an immortal body, pay no heed. A Wulver is as mortal as you & me. So, should you come across one of these creatures shrouded in the black air, whilst they show no aggression if left undisturbed, Wulvers are very protective of those whom they watch over. If the Wulver detects any sign that their protected are in harm's way, they may become dominant."

Once yer wee one has been taken, he will be exchanged with  a goblin. A grotesque child, malformed with giant ears. Your little one will have not sweet milky breath, but will emanate a pungent and foul odor from its mouth. Its appetite will triple, and ev'ry drop of milk will not suffice."

    old "Should you wish your child to return, you must follow the following guidance. All elves love to laugh. Their sinister actions can only be reversed with jollies. Keep in mind, they do not enjoy traditional humour. They live to taunt and be taunted. Coax the elf into your dwelling with bits of cake or drams of strong spirit. Once you have your elf, fling dishes, smash chairs, run the course of your home with flaming candles. The elf will be quick to join the foolish revelry, and fall to a pile in laughing fits. It is then he will concede to return your precious infant."

    old "Beware the creature as she weaves her way through the icy sea, twisting her body in and amongst every dark and rocky crevice. A selkie can willfully stretch her body and shed her skin, changing from thick, fatty seal to lithe womanly form as she makes her way to dry land to taunt and tease unsuspecting eyes. As mischievous as she is trusting, the selkie may draw you in with her beguiling gaze and try to lure you into the depths of her watery home. You may never know if you have been enchanted or enslaved.\nBut just as swiftly, a daring soul can steal her away from her underwater lair. The Orkney know all too well the tale of Abhainn Muir who was able to abscond with the skin of a selkie maiden, preventing her from returning to the water, and keeping her as a wife. After she bore him several children, she found the hidden pelt, slipping back into her skin and the ocean. The abandoned children, and generations to follow, were cursed with webbed fingers and toes."

With ink black fur and a distinct white spot across the chest, the Cat Sìth possesses a majestic beauty along with its fearsome snarl. But the lithe four-legged animal at your feet is not simply there for a fresh sardine. Without appropriate distraction, the Cat Sìth will steal your soul faster than the blink of an eye. Adequate distraction with commonly save you from her evils, but should Samhain pass without ye placing a saucer of fresh warm milk out for the sìth, the creature will return to suck the teats of yer herd dry, ne'er to be blessed with milk again, even with help from the Banarach."

Yet she may only do so nine times, lest she be cursed to remain a cat after her final transformation. Her trigger is unknown, but thought to be a gentle touch in the wrong direction.\nThere are but five known men who can describe the chilling transformation of the Cat Sìth. One Amhuinn Foirbeiseach from Invermoriston is recorded in the year 1821 as seeing \"a demonic elongation of limbs atop Sròn Na Muic.\" Once the cat became human, she stared down young Foirbeiseach until he submitted to her will. His tale of survival can be read in its entirety in Baird's Reflections of Tales Told, the comprehensive historic record of human and fae interactions."

Despite the visage of a humble sheepdog, their innards are stone cold. Woe to those who leave a gate unlatched, as a hungry wolf will enter to steal anything it can find, whether your tempting flock, or your wee one. Beware the sharp-fanged and foul creature.

    old "Stay clear should you encounter a wolf. They offer no gentleness, nothing more than destruction, harm, and predation. Thieves all, wolves know no boundaries. No stone wall will keep them at bay. They will gnaw, beg, purloin until they are sated, which is nigh upon ne'er. With their massive and powerful jaws, they will tear deep into the earth to uncover the bones of the dead. Stories are told of women waking to fields strewn with upturned soil and the severed limbs of their livestock. A vile creature, the wolf, causing such panic that forced Scots to bury their kin offshore on distant islands.\nA man in Drumdargour claimed to have tamed a wolf, by offering it scraps of his evening haggis, and calming it with drams of whisky. The animal was determined by his village priest to be a hybrid wolf-dog, and immediately ordered to be burned. At which time, the wolf bolted and was not seen again.\n{i}Nota bene:{/i} Though it is claimed that the last wolf in Scotland was killed in the late 17th century by Sir Lochlainn Stewart in Eaglais Fheichein, Dumfries, many a Scot claim to have seen wolves roaming the Highlands up through the days of Bonnie Prince Charlie."

It has come time to discuss the epic creature of the dark skies and chilling landscape, the nightmarish fever dream that haunts youth and adults alike... the dragon.\nFiery and huge, with a typical wingspan measured in rods, the dragon is so easy to picture, yet so hard to describe. Born of a single, mottled egg, this fearsome beast doubles in size within hours, reaching its adult height in mere days.

The fire from their roar will char a home to the ground in the blink of an eye. Fire-breathing dragons can be tamed by few; witches all. Ne'er follow a siren to the cave of a dragon lest ye are looking to be tormented.\nWhat good these dragons be? While the males are full of unquenchable rage and desire for destruction, it is well-known that the female of the species possess a cunning nature, one that is both alluring and also just as deadly. Beware her hypnotic gaze, those glowing red eyes of mystery and deceit. They will lure you with the taunt of pleasure, only to offer you a slow death filled with unimaginable pain. But whilst on the prowl nightly, these female dragons protect all, summoning vengeance only on those most deserving, providing shelter and rescue to those most in need.\nIn 1859, a young woman claimed to have found cracked dragon egg shells the size of human heads on the shores of Ach-na-Creige near castle ruins. Her story was never confirmed, but the shell fragments are on prominent display to this day at the Northern Shores Hightower Museum in Plockton. Curators claim the shells glow during specific moon cycles, and offer restorative properties to various skin conditions when handled deftly."

This serendipitous incident induced a hallucination that he never forgot. Within this memory, Baird changed his born gender, turning into a woman Kelpie, the shapeshifting water horse. By the time he awoke from the dream state, he was in shock to see himself back to his male self. This tale is further chronicled in his memoir, {i}From Body to Soul: The Transformation of My Eternal Vessel.{/i}\nForthwith following this experience, Baird set out into the Highlands and beyond to catalogue the rare flora of the Scottish landscape, compiling their uses and effects in his encyclopaedia, {i}The Scotman's comestible botanicals.{/i}"

When he commented on her cloven hooves creating a faint din on the wood floors of a pub in an undisclosed location, she scoffed at him, telling him he was a drunken fool. Believing his past delirium in becoming a Kelpie gave him the power to see fae-born among his surroundings, he cornered the woman late in the evening as she made her way back home. He shared his tale of phantasmagoria, and this time she took notice, even lifting her skirt briefly to reveal her hooven goat legs. Their shared bond continued in the form of letters over the years, though Baird has honoured his promise never to reveal her secret.\nThese escapades and more have inspired the tales and history compiled in {i}Baird's Unabridged Compendium of Faerie Lore: Rhymes, Myths & Legends of Scotch Tradition.{/i} Reading through this marvelous wonder will connect you to fae culture, kingdoms, and creatures as tightly as the bond that once existed between man and the faerie realm.\nThis chronicle is faithfully and humbly compiled, executed, and confirmed by Robert Columba Crimthann Baird on this third day of September in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five."
